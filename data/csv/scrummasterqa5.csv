"1","1. Explain Agile in brief. \nAgile is a popular set of methods and practices that majorly focuses on interactive development. Thanks to self-organizing collaborations between cross-functional teams, the requirements from their customers and potential solutions are obtained."
"2","2. Explain the difference between the traditional Waterfall model and the Agile model.\nAgile\n\nWaterfall\n\nIt is a continuous iteration lifecycle model used for developing and testing software\n\nIt is a linear sequential lifecycle model for developing and testing software\n\nIt is a flexible method to build a software\n\nIt is a rigid and structured method for software development\n\nIt is highly collaborative, thus yielding quality output\n\nIt follows a rigid sequence of steps, hence team collaboration is difficult\n\nThe process of development is divided into sprints\n\nThe process is broken down into several phases\n\nChanges can be made even after the initial planning is completed\n\nOnce the project development has started, development requirements cannot be changed\n\nDevelopment is a collection of many projects\n\nDevelopment is completed as a simple project or deliverable\n\nTesting is performed in the same iteration\n\nThe testing phase follows the build phase"
"3","3. What are some important parts of the Agile process\nThe different principles of Agile are:\n\n1. Customer Satisfaction\nThe needs of the customer need to be satisfied with the early and quick delivery of the product.\n\n2. Welcome Changes\nChanging needs need to be addressed, even if they are brought in late in the development process.\n\n3. Deliver Frequently\nEnsure frequent product delivery within a short timeframe, thanks to a clear cut understanding of the product.\n\n4. Work Together\nDevelopers and other team members need to work together through in collaboration with the course of the project.\n\n5. Motivated Team\nMotivated and driven individuals who are trusted to get the job done can ensure the success of the project.\n\n6. Face-to-Face Conversations\nHaving face-to-face conversations is proven as the most efficient method for communication.\n\n7. Working Software\nThis represents the primary measure of progress.\n\n8. Constant Pace\nWith a constant pace, the agile process enables optimum sustainable development.\n\n9. Good Design\nBy focusing on technical excellence and great design, the agility of the project can be improved drastically.\n\n10. Simplicity\nThe amount of time spent not doing work has to be minimized and simplified.\n\n11. Self-Organized\nSelf-organized teams provide the best architectures, requirements, and designs.\n\n12. Reflect and Adjust\nThe effectiveness of the Agile process can be improved by regularly reflecting on it."
"4","4. Explain Iterative and Incremental Development in Agile.\nTo understand how these processes work in Agile, we’ll have to talk about each one of them individually.\n\nIncremental Development\nIn this form of development, the process is divided into small, workable increments. Each succeeding increment builds on the work completed in the previous increment. Over time, functionalities are added based on everything already created.\n\nIterative Development\nThis involves the development of a system that follows repeated cycles or iterations. Changes are made based on results from the most recent iteration. This enables the project to evolve over time.\n\nAgile: Incremental+Iterative\nThe agile process involves the consideration and creation of a working product in an iteration, which is a part of the final product. Each successive iteration is one step further towards the final product. This continues until all product functionalities are satisfied. \n\nOrganizations and users use the working product and provide feedback that’s incorporated into the next iteration. With this, product roadmaps can be built, produced, and tested before the next iteration.\n\nThis is one of the most common and important Agile Interview Questions that everyone should know the answers to."
"5","5. What are the different types of Agile methodologies?\n1. Extreme Programming\nIt is a framework that enables teams to create high-quality software that helps improve their quality of life. It enables software development alongside relevant and appropriate engineering practices. It is applicable to handle changing software requirements, risks caused due to new software, working with a small, extended development team, and technology that allows automated unit and functional tests.\n\n2. Kanban\nIt is a method that’s used to design, manage, and improve the flow of systems. Kanban enables organizations to visualize their flow of work and limit the amount of work in progress. It is used in situations where work arrives unpredictably, and where work needs to be deployed immediately without waiting for other work items. \n\n3. Lean\nIt is a set of tools and principles that focuses on identifying and removing waste, to speed up process development. Value is maximized, and waste is minimized. It is used in just about every industry that produces waste in some form or the other. \n\n4. Scrum\nIt is a framework that is used by teams to establish a hypothesis, test it, reflect on the experience, and make adjustments. It enables teams to incorporate practices from other frameworks depending on the requirements. It is used by cross-functional teams that are working on product development, and the work is split into more than one 2-4 week iterations. \n\n5. Crystal\nIt focuses on people and their interactions, rather than on tools and processes. Aimed to streamline processes and improve optimization, Crystal works on the principle that projects are unique and dynamic. It is used when the focus is on strengthening team communication, continuous integration, active user involvement, and configurable processes."
"6","6. What Are the Principles of Agile Testing?\nTesting continuously to ensure continuous improvement of the product\nContinuous feedback to ensure the product satisfies the business requirements\nTeam roles like testing and development need to be actively involved in the testing process\nActively involving the business team and user representatives can help obtain quick feedback for each iteration\nClean and simplified code ensures it is defect-free during the iteration\nDocumentation created must limit itself to a particular iteration\nTesting is done alongside development and implementation, to ensure that the product is free from defects\nInvolving the user ensures the final product matches their requirements."
"7","7. What are some Agile metrics that need to be focused on?\nMeasuring the burndown of deliverables, usually represented in burndown charts\nVelocity\nLead time\nCycle time\nCode quality\nCode covered in unit test\nDeployment success rate\nNet promoter score"
"8","8. What Is Kanban?\nKanban is a visual system that helps the management of work as it progresses through the process. It visualizes and provides visibility into the process, workflows, and the work that’s passing through the process. It is also known as a pull system, as new work is pulled from a list, executed, and moved from ‘in-progress’ status to ‘done’ Tracking work is also made easier as the workflow is visible and put on a display board. Modern organizations can also use the digital display systems. \n\nIn Kanban, the goal is to identify constraints or potential bottlenecks in the process and ensure they are addressed. It also helps make the workflow smoother and more efficient."
"9","9. What are some popular Agile tools?"
"10","10. What are the obstacles to the Agile process?\nSome of the obstacles that could be faced are: \n\nNot having appropriate or sufficient tools and technologies\nThe lack of active involvement from the customers\nTeam members that are lacking in skills and capability\nThe inability to design systems based on unseen requirements\nSuccessfully adopting the Agile culture to the organization"
"11","11. Differentiate between Agile and Scrum. \nAgile\n\nScrum\n\nIt is a set of principles that’s iterative and incremental in nature\n\nIt is an implementation of the Agile methodology\n\nSuited for projects involving a small team of experts\n\nUsed in teams that need to handle constant changing requirements\n\nThe project head takes care of all tasks and is vital to the project\n\nNo leader. Issues are handled by the scrum master and the team\n\nChanges cannot be handled frequently\n\nTeams can react to change quickly\n\nRequires frequent delivery to the end-user\n\nSprints provide workable builds of the final product to the user for feedback\n\nFace-to-face interactions between cross-functional teams\n\nDaily stand-up meetings help with collaboration\n\nDesign and execution is simple\n\nDesign and execution can be innovative and experimental"
