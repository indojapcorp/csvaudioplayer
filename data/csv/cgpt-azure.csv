Here is a brief explanation of some of the core Azure services:\n\nVirtual Machines (VMs): Azure VMs allow you to create and run virtual machines in the cloud, providing you with flexible and scalable computing resources.\n\nApp Service: App Service is a platform for hosting web applications, mobile app backends, and RESTful APIs. It supports various programming languages and frameworks.\n\nAzure Functions: Azure Functions is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code on-demand without managing infrastructure. It enables you to build event-driven applications and microservices.\n\nStorage: Azure Storage offers various types of storage options, such as Blob storage for unstructured data, File storage for file shares, and Queue and Table storage for messaging and NoSQL databases.\n\nAzure SQL Database: Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service that allows you to build and run mission-critical applications in the cloud.\n\nCosmos DB: Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service that supports NoSQL data models such as document, key-value, graph, and column-family.\n\nAzure Active Directory (AD): Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service that allows you to manage user accounts and access to applications and resources.\n\nAzure DevOps: Azure DevOps is a set of development tools that provides end-to-end automation and collaboration for software development teams.\n\nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS): AKS is a fully managed Kubernetes container orchestration service that allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications in the cloud.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many services offered by Azure. The platform also provides services for analytics, AI and machine learning, networking, security, and more."
