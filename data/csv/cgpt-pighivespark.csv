It then filters out any records with a status code of 404 using the FILTER operator and stores the filtered records in a relation called logs_filtered.\n\nNext, the script groups the filtered records by IP address using the GROUP operator and counts the number of requests for each IP using the COUNT function. The results are stored in a relation called ip_counts.\n\nThe script then orders the results by the number of requests in descending order using the ORDER operator and stores the results in a file called ip_counts.txt using the STORE operator."

Each line of the file contains comma-separated values representing the movie ID, title, and genres.\n\nThe script first loads the movie data into a relation called movies. It then filters out any records with missing or invalid data using the FILTER operator and stores the filtered records in a relation called movies_filtered.\n\nNext, the script transforms the genre field to create one record per genre using the FOREACH operator and the FLATTEN and TOKENIZE functions. The results are stored in a relation called movies_genre_split.\n\nThe script then groups the records by genre using the GROUP operator and counts the number of movies in each genre using the COUNT function.

"4","Code Apache Hive script to process log\nSure, here's an example Apache Hive script to process log data:\n\nsql\nCopy code\n-- Create a table to store the log data\nCREATE TABLE logs (\n  ip STRING,\n  date STRING,\n  method STRING,\n  url STRING,\n  status INT,\n  size INT\n)\nROW FORMAT DELIMITED\nFIELDS TERMINATED BY ','\nSTORED AS TEXTFILE;\n\n-- Load the log data into the table\nLOAD DATA INPATH 'hdfs://localhost:9000/log_data.txt' INTO TABLE logs;\n\n-- Filter out any records with a status code of 404\nCREATE TABLE logs_filtered AS\nSELECT *\nFROM logs\nWHERE status != 404;\n\n-- Group the records by IP address and count the number of requests for each IP\nCREATE TABLE ip_counts AS\nSELECT ip, COUNT(*) AS requests\nFROM logs_filtered\nGROUP BY ip;\n\n-- Order the results by the number of requests in descending order\nCREATE TABLE ip_counts_ordered AS\nSELECT *\nFROM ip_counts\nORDER BY requests DESC;\n\n-- Store the results in a file\nINSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/user/ip_counts.txt' \nROW FORMAT DELIMITED\nFIELDS TERMINATED BY ','\nSELECT *\nFROM ip_counts_ordered;\nThis script assumes that the log data is in a file called log_data.txt located in HDFS at hdfs://localhost:9000/.\n\nThe script first creates a table called logs to store the log data. It then loads the log data from the file into the logs table using the LOAD DATA statement.\n\nNext, the script creates a table called logs_filtered to store the filtered log data, which excludes any records with a status code of 404. This is done using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause.\n\nThe script then creates a table called ip_counts to store the aggregated data, which counts the number of requests for each IP address. This is done using a SELECT statement with a GROUP BY clause.\n\nThe script then creates a table called ip_counts_ordered to store the ordered results. This is done using a SELECT statement with an ORDER BY clause.\n\nFinally, the script stores the results in a local file called ip_counts.txt using the INSERT OVERWRITE statement with a SELECT statement that retrieves the data from the ip_counts_ordered table and writes it to the file."
"5","ETL use case using Apache Spark\nSure! Here's an ETL use case using Apache Spark:\n\nLet's say you have a large dataset of sales transactions stored in CSV format on HDFS. The dataset contains the following columns:\n\ntransaction_id: The ID of the transaction\ncustomer_id: The ID of the customer who made the purchase\nproduct_id: The ID of the product being purchased\nquantity: The quantity of the product being purchased\nprice: The price of the product being purchased\ntimestamp: The timestamp of the transaction\nYou want to perform some ETL operations on this dataset to transform it and load it into a data warehouse. Specifically, you want to:\n\nFilter out any transactions with missing or invalid data.\nCalculate the total revenue generated by each product.\nCalculate the total revenue generated by each customer.\nLoad the transformed data into a database table.\nHere's how you can achieve this using Apache Spark:\n\npython\nCopy code\n# Import necessary modules\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, sum\n\n# Create a Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName('SalesDataETL').getOrCreate()\n\n# Load the sales data from HDFS into a DataFrame\nsales_data = spark.read.csv('hdfs://localhost:9000/sales_data.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)\n\n# Filter out any transactions with missing or invalid data\nsales_data_filtered = sales_data.filter(col('transaction_id').isNotNull() & col('customer_id').isNotNull() & col('product_id').isNotNull() & col('quantity').isNotNull() & col('price').isNotNull() & col('timestamp').isNotNull())\n\n# Calculate the total revenue generated by each product\nproduct_revenue = sales_data_filtered.groupBy('product_id').agg(sum(col('quantity') * col('price')).alias('total_revenue'))\n\n# Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer\ncustomer_revenue = sales_data_filtered.groupBy('customer_id').agg(sum(col('quantity') * col('price')).alias('total_revenue'))\n\n# Load the transformed data into a database table\nproduct_revenue.write.format('jdbc').options(url='jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sales_data', driver='com.mysql.jdbc.Driver', dbtable='product_revenue', user='username', password='password').mode('overwrite').save()\ncustomer_revenue.write.format('jdbc').options(url='jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sales_data', driver='com.mysql.jdbc.Driver', dbtable='customer_revenue', user='username', password='password').mode('overwrite').save()\n\n# Stop the Spark session\nspark.stop()\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\nIt creates a Spark session using the SparkSession module.\nIt loads the sales data from HDFS into a DataFrame using the read.csv() method.\nIt filters out any transactions with missing or invalid data using the filter() method and the isNotNull() function.\nIt calculates the total revenue generated by each product and each customer using the groupBy() method and the agg() function with the sum() function.\nIt loads the transformed data into a database table using the write() method with the jdbc format and the appropriate options for the database connection.\nIt stops the Spark session using the stop() method.\nThis ETL pipeline can be scheduled to run on a regular basis to keep the database updated with the latest sales data."
