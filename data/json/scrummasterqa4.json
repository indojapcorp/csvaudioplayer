How can you coordinate between multiple teams?\nOne of the most common approaches for this is the Scrum of Scrums (SoS) meeting, where members representing each scrum team discuss the progress, performance, issues, risks, etc. together.\nThe frequency of these meetings must be pre-defined. Generally, scrum masters would represent a particular scrum team, besides having the Chief Scrum Master (whose responsibility is coordination & collaboration among all the scrums) who facilitates these meetings."},{"id":32,"text":"32. What are the Scrum values?\nThe five Scrum Values are:\n\nOpenness - In order for the Scrum team to make the most progress in the shortest time feasible, each member of the team must be completely honest about their personal development. The objective of the daily Scrum meeting is to identify and address problems. That will happen only if team members are open about any issues or roadblocks they're seeing. Members of the team should be willing to work together and regard each other as important contributions to the project's success.\nScrum masters can create openness by being honest with their teams. Giving honest feedback at daily Scrum meetings inspires team members to be open and honest in return and is important for making necessary modifications.\n\nCourage - Scrum teams must have the courage to be authentic, open, and honest with themselves and stakeholders about any bottlenecks they experience and the project's progress. Members of the team must also be gutsy enough to ask for help when they need it, try unfamiliar procedures, techniques, and respectfully disagree and debate openly. Scrum masters should foster courage first and foremost by demonstrating it just like respect. In order to avoid mid-sprint modifications or scope creep, the Scrum Master must have the confidence to stand up to product owners and stakeholders.\nFocus - To get the most out of each sprint, every team member must remain focused on the task at hand and how it influences the sprint goal. To keep team members engaged throughout sprints, scrum masters may limit the number of tasks or priority allocated to each team member. Individuals can also stay on task by making sure that the whole team is engaged in daily Scrum sessions.\nRespect - In a Scrum team, respect is accepting that no one person or contribution is more valuable than the other. Respect means appreciating your accomplishments, trusting your teammates to fulfill their tasks and also considering their ideas, and listening to them. Scrum masters may help their teams create mutual respect by demonstrating respect for the team members, product owners, and stakeholders.\nCommitment - To achieve a common purpose, scrum teams must work together. This means trusting one another to finish their tasks and deliver their best. It will only happen only if every member of the team is entirely committed to the team and the project."},{"id":33,"text":"33. How would you handle conflict within the team?\nGiving individual coaching to team members is one of the most effective strategies to resolve a problem. It is imperative for a Scrum Master to maintain positive relationships with team members and provide guidance when they face challenges.\n\nFor a Scrum Master, paying attention to the source of the problem and listening and acting accordingly would go a long way. Any disagreements should be shared with other team members in a manner that they would be open to suggestions for resolving the issue. When a conflict arises, the Scrum Master must intervene so that the process runs smoothly and without hiccups.\n\nThe following steps help in handling conflicts within the team:\n\nStep 1 - Scene setting\n\nFirst, we must determine the source of the team's quarrel. Before taking any action, it is necessary to understand the discrepancy between two groups or two persons. In times of dispute, Scrum Masters typically react aggressively against team members in the hopes of resolving the conflict on their own. However, while this may temporarily cure the problem, it does not address any underlying concerns. The Scrum Master must lead the team and teach them that disagreement is a regular occurrence in the workplace and it can be resolved with assertiveness. It is the leader's responsibility to guarantee that team members' concerns are acknowledged and addressed.\n\nStep 2 - Gathering Information\n\nGathering facts about the conflict is usually crucial before coming to a conclusion about a certain individual or suppressing the topic. This could be accomplished by listening to each party separately and comprehending the situation from their point of view. The Scrum Master should also consider other team members' perspectives and also respect every team member’s decisions. As a result, the Scrum Master must elicit everyone's assistance in order to gain a picture of the workplace conflict.\n\nStep 3 - Brainstorming to find a solution\n\nIt is often impossible for the leader to resolve problems on his or her own. Furthermore, several members of the Scrum Team would have better answers that would quickly remedy the problem. Organizing spontaneous group talks and sharing opinions on various activities would stimulate good discourse between the two people or groups in these situations. This would urge both sides to see things from the other's perspective. This also provides opportunities for superior ideas to be pushed and for the disparity to be bridged.\n\nStep 4 - Solution conferring\n\nListing all of the possible answers to an issue would only be useful if those solutions were put into action. Scrum Master removes the team's roadblocks by implementing the solution in this step. Throughout the conflict resolution process, remembering to stay calm and respectful will aid in a speedier and more efficient resolution."},{"id":34,"text":"34. How would you deal with a difficult stakeholder?\nThe four strategies by which we can deal with difficult stakeholders are:\n\nListen to them carefully - Make an effort to comprehend their point of view. If what they say aggravates you, consider whether their needs are in line with the project's goals. Is it possible that they want things done a little differently? Make efforts to discover some common ground. People desire to be understood and to believe that their voices are heard.\nEstimate their motivation - Try to understand the motivation behind the stakeholders’ opposition. This will allow you to compromise, and come up with a win-win solution, and complete the project. Answer questions like - Are they reporting to a board of directors that has its own reservations? What's the source of your stakeholders' sudden opposition? Are they concerned about exceeding their budget? Concerned that the project may not turn out as planned? \nMeet them one after another - Meeting without other stakeholders in the room relieves stress and allows the stakeholders’ to be more at ease. So, make time to meet with each challenging stakeholder separately. This results in interactions becoming clearer and calmer. Take advantage of this chance to learn more about their point of view and recommended solutions. However, don't ask them why they don't like your plan outright. Ask open-ended inquiries about their thoughts and how the project is moving instead.\nWatch the stakeholders closely by identifying them - Determining the stakeholders and finding out what inspires them should be the first step. Anyone who is influenced by our work has control or influence over it or is interested in its success is referred to as a stakeholder."},{"id":35,"text":"35. What are the three pillars of Scrum?\nThe three pillars of Scrum are summarized below -\n\nAdaption: The method being processed must be changed if an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process are outside of permitted limits. A correction must be made as quickly as possible to avoid future deviation.\n\nTransparency: Transparency mandates that those elements be specified by a consistent standard in order for viewers to understand what they are viewing. For example, while referring to the process, all participants must use the same terminology. Those reviewing as well as those executing the job and the resulting addition must have the same definition of \"done.\"\n\nInspection: Scrum users must check Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal on a regular basis to discover unwanted deviations. Inspections should not be carried out so frequently that they constitute a burden to their work. Inspections are most successful when skilled inspectors do them attentively at the point of work."},{"id":36,"text":"36. Explain user story structure with an example.\nThe User Story Structure is defined below -\n\nAs a <role of user>,\n\nI want <To achieve a goal / perform a task>,\n\nSo that <I may achieve some value/goal>.\n\nExample:\n\nUser Story of a person’s online course purchase -\n\nAs a Customer,\n\nI want to purchase educational courses online from ed-tech websites,\n\nSo that I do not have to visit a training center."},{"id":37,"text":"37. How can you assure that the user stories meet the requirements?\nA good user narrative includes both a description and acceptance criteria. It should be completed in a sprint with the fewest possible dependencies. The team should be able to develop and test while still delivering estimations within the sprint's constraints. In short, good user stories adhere to the INVEST concept.\n\nI → Independent: The user story should be written in such a way that team members are less dependent on one another.\n\nN → Negotiable: it should define the functionality of the user story and is subject to the Product Owner and the Team’s approval.\n\nV → Valuable: It should offer value to the customer's experience.\n\nE → Estimable: This lets us be able to roughly approximate in terms of time.\n\nS → Small: The user story should be tiny enough for the team to finish in a sprint.\n\nT → Testable: Good acceptance criteria after testing is required."},{"id":38,"text":"38. What are the five steps of Risk Management?\nThe five steps of Risk Management are given below -\n\nRisk Identification: To identify the risks that your company is exposed to in its current operating environment. There are several types of risks, such as market risks, legal risks, regulatory risks, environmental risks, etc. It's crucial to be aware of as many risk factors as possible.\n\nRisk Analysis: Once a risk has been identified, it must be investigated. The scope of the danger must be determined. It's also important to understand the connection between other internal factors and risk. It's critical to determine the risk's severity and importance by examining how it affects the business operations.\n\nRanking the risk: Risks must be ranked and prioritized. Most risk management solutions include numerous risk categories based on the severity of the danger. Risks that may cause minor discomfort are prioritized the least, but risks that can result in significant loss are prioritized the highest.\n\nTreating the risk: As much as possible, all risks should be avoided or reduced by contacting experts in the field in question. In a manual environment, this would include contacting each and every stakeholder and setting up meetings for everyone to discuss the issues.\n\nRisk review: To ensure that it has been entirely eradicated, the risk evaluation is done."},{"id":39,"text":"39. What do you mean by timeboxing in Scrum? When can a Sprint be canceled, and by whom?\nTimeboxing is the practice of devoting a set amount of time to a single activity. A timebox is a unit of time measurement. A timebox should not exceed 15 minutes in length. A Sprint can be canceled before the Sprint timebox limit ends. Only a Product Owner can cancel the sprint."},{"id":40,"text":"40. What do you understand about Scope Creep? How can Scope Creep be managed?\nScope creep is used to describe how a project's requirements tend to grow over time, like - a single deliverable product becomes five when a product with three essential features becomes ten, or when the customer's needs change midway through a project, requiring a reassessment of the project requirements. Changes in project needs from internal miscommunication and disagreements, and key stakeholders are some of the common causes of scope creep.\n\nTo manage scope creep, we need to use the change control mechanism to keep it under control. This includes the following -\n\nMaintaining a baseline scope and keeping track of the project's progress.\nTo evaluate actual work performance metrics to the baseline scope, i.e., \"How different is the current project from the original plan?\", we need to perform Variance analysis.\nIdentifying the severity and source of the observed alterations.\nSelecting whether to take preventive or corrective action in response to requests regarding changes.\nTo recommend actions and manage all change requests by using the Perform Integrated Change Control method (whether preventive or corrective)."},{"id":41,"text":"41. When should a Scrum Master not act as a facilitator? \nA workshop facilitator must be objective when it comes to the topics being discussed and should avoid contributing facts or opinions to the conversation. Even though a Scrum Master's job is to assist the team in achieving the best possible results, workshop facilitation can be challenging at times. Most of the general product development workshops can be facilitated by the Scrum Master if someone has the required knowledge. The Scrum Master should not facilitate a workshop about modifying the Scrum process."}]}
