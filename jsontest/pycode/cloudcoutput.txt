They make changes easier and quicker.
Their scalability makes it easier to adapt the service as needed.
####
22. What is an AMI? How do we implement it?
AMI is Amazon Machine Image, which basically is a copy of your root file system. It feeds the information required to launch an instance.

We implement AMI by specifying an AMI whenever we want to launch an instance. Multiple instances can be launched from a single AMI with the same configuration.
In the case of launching instances with different configurations, we would need to launch different AMIs.

AMI
AMI includes one or more snapshots of your EBS volumes, in the case of instance-store-backed AMIs, along with a template for the root volume of your instance (like an operating system, an application server, and applications).

It launches the permissions that decide which AWS accounts can use the AMI for launching instances. It also needs a block device mapping for specifying the volumes in order to attach them to the instances whenever they are launched.


####

Creation of applications is made easy and accessible for the link of cloud services with other systems.
####
33. Mention different data center deployments of Cloud Computing.
Cloud Computing consists of different data centers as follows:

Containerized data centers: Containerized data centers are packages that contain a consistent set of servers, network components, and storage delivered to large warehouse kind of facilities. Here, each deployment is relatively unique.
Low-density data centers: Containerized data centers promote heavy density which in turn causes much heat and significant engineering troubles. Low-density data centers are the solution to this problem. Here, the equipment is established far apart so that it cools down the generated heat.

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services which is a collection of remote computing services also known as Cloud Computing. This technology is also known as IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service.


####
38. Mention the key components of AWS.
The key components of AWS are as follows:

AWS Route 53: AWS Route 53 is a DNS (Domain Name Server) web-based service platform.
Simple E-mail Service: Sending of e-mail is done by using a RESTFUL API call or via regular SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
Identity and Access Management: Improvised security and identity management are provided for an AWS account.
Simple Storage Device (S3): It is a huge storage medium, widely used for AWS services.
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): It allows on-demand computing resources for hosting applications and is essentially useful for unpredictable workloads.
Elastic Block Stores (EBS): They are storage volumes attached to EC2 and allow the data lifespan of a single EC2.
CloudWatch: Amazon CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS resources, and it allows administrators to view and collect the keys required. Access is provided so that one can set a notification alarm in the case of trouble.
Go through the Challenges of Cloud Computing Blog to know about the challenges you can face while working.

####
39. Explain how you can vertically scale an Amazon instance.
This is one of the essential features of AWS and cloud virtualization. We spinup a newly developed large instance where we pause that instance and detach the root EBS volume from the server and discard. Later, we stop our live instance and detach its root volume connected. here, we note down the unique device ID and attach the same root volume to the new server, and we restart it again. This results in a vertically scaled Amazon instance.

####
40. Explain the security usage in the Amazon Web Services model.
AWS supports security groups.
Access is provided to create a security group for a jump box with SSH access only for port 22 open. Later, a webserver group and a database group are created. The webserver group provides 80 and 443 from around the world, but only port 22 will be vital among the jump box group. The database group allows port 3306 from the webserver group and port 22 from the jump box group. The addition of any machines to the webserver group can store in the database. No one can directly SSH to any of our boxes.

####
41. What are reasons that make Amazon so big?
In Amazon, the backup storage of EBS volumes is maintained by inserting the snapshot facility via an API call or via a GUI interface like Elasticfox.
Performance is improved by using Linux software RAID and striping across four volumes.


####
42. How does Resource Replication take place in Cloud Computing?
Resource Replication creates duplicates of the same resource. Replication is employed when a resource is needed more and more. The resource is virtualized to replicate cloud-based resources.

####
43. What is Containers as a Service (CaaS)?
CaaS is a system that allows developers to run, scale, manage, upload, and organize containers by using virtualization.

A container is a software pack. It allows teams to scale their apps to highly available cloud infrastructures.
