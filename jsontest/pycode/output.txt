Each strategy has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of strategy depends on the specific needs of the project and the team.

Advanced DevOps Interview Questions for experienced
####
51. What are the benefits of using version control?
It helps improve the collaborative work culture: Here, team members are allowed to work freely on any file at any time. The version control system allows us to merge all changes into a common version.
It keeps different versions of code files securely: All the previous versions and variants of code files are neatly packed up inside the version control system.
It understands what happened: Every time we save a new version of our project, the version control system asks us to provide a short description of what was changed. More than that it allows us to see what changes were made in the file’s content, as well as who has made those changes.
It keeps a backup: A distributed version control system like Git allows all team members to access the complete history of the project file so that in case there is a breakdown in the central server, they can use any of their teammate’s local Git repository.
####
52. Can you tell me the advantages of using Git?
Data redundancy and replication
High availability
Only one Git directory per repository
Superior disk utilization and network performance
Collaboration friendly
Can be used for any sort of project
####
53. Are git fetch and git pull the same?
The command ‘git pull’ pulls any new commits from a branch from the central repository and then updates the target branch in the local repository.

But, ‘git fetch’ is a slightly different form of ‘git pull’. Unlike ‘git pull’, it pulls all new commits from the desired branch and then stores them in a new branch in the local repository.

In order to reflect these changes in your target branch, ‘git fetch’ must be followed with a ‘git merge’. The target branch will only be updated after merging with the fetched branch (where we performed ‘git fetch’). We can also interpret the whole thing with an equation like this:

git pull = git fetch + git merge

####
54. How do you handle merge conflicts in Git?
In order to resolve merge conflicts in Git, we need to follow three steps:

Understand what happened: It could be because of the same line being edited on the same file; it could be because of deleting some files, or it could also be because of files with the same file names. You can check everything by using ‘git status’.
Mark and clean up the conflict: When we open the files using the merge tool, Git marks the conflicted area like this ‘<<<<< HEAD’ and ‘ >>>>> [other/branch/name]’.
Perform the commit again and then merge the current branch with the master branch.
Go through this GIT Cheat Sheet and know more about GIT.

####
55. Can you tell me some advantages of the forking workflow over other Git workflows?
The forking workflow is fundamentally different from other Git workflows. Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the ‘central’ codebase, the forking workflow gives every developer their server-side repositories. This workflow is most often seen in public open-source projects.The main advantage is that contributions can be integrated without the need for everyone to push to a single central repository to maintain a clean project history. Developers can push to their server-side repositories, and only the one who maintains the project will push it to the official repository.As soon as developers are ready to publish their local commits, they will push their commits to their public repositories. Then, they will perform a pull request from the main repository which notifies the project manager that an update is ready to be integrated.Interested in learning DevOps?

####
56. When do you use ‘git rebase’ instead of ‘git merge’?
Both ‘git rebases’ and ‘git merge’ commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branch: just that they just do it in different ways.

When we perform rebase of a feature branch onto the master branch, we move the base of the feature branch to the master branch’s ending point.

By performing a merge, we take the contents of the feature branch and integrate them with the master branch. As a result, only the master branch is changed, but the feature branch history remains the same. Merging adds a new commit to your history.

Rebasing will create inconsistent repositories. For individuals, rebasing makes a lot of sense. Now, in order to see the history completely, the same way as it has happened, we should use merge. Merge preserves history, whereas rebase rewrites it.


####
57. I just made a bad git commit and made it public, and I need to revert the commit. Can you suggest how to do that?
Here we need to use the Git command:

git revert <name the commit you wish to revert>

This command can revert any command just by adding the commit ID.

####
58. Can you tell me how to squash the last n commits into a single commit? Is it even possible?
To squash the last n commits into a single commit, we can use:

git reset — soft HEAD~n &&

git commit

####

Following are the different components of Selenium:

Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE) – The Selenium IDE consists of a simple framework and comes with a Firefox plug-in that can be easily installed. This Selenium component should be used for prototyping.
Selenium Remote Control (RC) – It is a testing framework for developers and QA that supports coding in any programming language like Java, PHP, C#, Perl, etc. This helps automate the UI testing process of web applications against any HTTP website.
Selenium WebDriver – It has a better approach to automating the testing process of web-based applications and does not rely on JavaScript. This web framework allows cross-browser tests to be performed.
Selenium Grid – This proxy server works with Selenium RC, and with the help of browsers, it is able to run parallel tests on different nodes or machines.
####
61. What are the testing types supported by Selenium?
Selenium supports regression testing and functional testing.

####
62. Are there any technical challenges with Selenium?
It supports only web-based applications.
It does not support the Bitmap comparison.
No vendor support is available for Selenium compared to commercial tools like HP UFT.
As there is no object repository concept, the maintainability of objects becomes very complex.

####
64. Describe the difference between driver.close() and driver.quit().
The driver.close command closes the focused browser window. But, the driver.quit command calls the driver.dispose method which closes all browser windows and also ends the WebDriver session.

####
65. I want to move or copy Jenkins from one server to another. Is it possible? If yes, how?
I would suggest copying the Jenkins jobs directory from the old server to the new one. We can just move a job from one installation of Jenkins to another by copying the corresponding job directory.

Or, we can also make a copy of an existing Jenkins job by making a clone of that job directory in a different name.

Another way is that we can rename an existing job by renaming the directory. But, if you change the name of a job, you will need to change any other job that tries to call the renamed job.


####
66. I have 40 jobs in the Jenkins dashboard and I need to build them all at once. Is it possible?
Yes, it is. With the help of a Jenkins plugin, we can build DevOps projects one after the other. If one parent job is carried out, then automatically other jobs are also run. We also have the option to use Jenkins Pipeline jobs for the same.

####
67. How will you secure Jenkins?
The way to secure Jenkins is as follows:

Ensure that global security is on
Check whether Jenkins is integrated with the company’s user directory with an appropriate plugin
Make sure that the Project matrix is enabled to fine-tune access
Automate the process of setting rights or privileges in Jenkins with a custom version-controlled script
Limit physical access to Jenkins data or folders
Periodically run security audits
####
68. Can you please tell me how to create a backup and copy files in Jenkins?
To create a backup, all we need to do is periodically back up our JENKINS_HOME directory. This contains all of the build configurations of our job, our slave node configurations, and our build history. To create a backup of our Jenkins setup, just copy this directory. We can also copy a job directory to clone or replicate a job or rename the directory.

####
69. What are Jenkins Pipeline and CI/CD Pipeline?
Jenkins Pipeline can be defined as a suite of plugins supporting both the implementation and integration of Jenkins’ continuous delivery pipeline.

Continuous integration or continuous delivery pipeline consists of build, deploy, test, and release. The pipeline feature is very time-saving. In other words, a pipeline is a group of build jobs that are chained and integrated in a sequence.

####
70. What are Puppet Manifests?
Every Puppet Node or Puppet Agent has got its configuration details in Puppet Master, written in the native Puppet language. These details are written in a language that Puppet can understand and are termed as Puppet Manifests. These manifests are composed of Puppet codes, and their filenames use the .pp extension.

For instance, we can write a manifest in Puppet Master that creates a file and installs Apache on all Puppet Agents or slaves that are connected to the Puppet Master.

####
71. How can I configure systems with Puppet?
In order to configure systems in a client or server architecture with Puppet, we need to use the Puppet Agent and the Puppet Master applications. In stand-alone architecture, we use the Puppet apply application.

####
72. What is a Puppet Module? How is it different from the Puppet Manifest?
A Puppet Module is nothing but a collection of manifests and data (e.g., facts, files, and templates). Puppet Modules have a specific directory structure. They are useful for organizing the Puppet code because, with Puppet Modules, we can split the Puppet code into multiple manifests. It is considered best practice to use Puppet Modules to organize almost all of your Puppet Manifests.

Puppet Modules are different from Puppet Manifests. Manifests are nothing but Puppet programs, composed of the Puppet code. File names of Puppet Manifests use the .pp extension.

####
75. How does Ansible work?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool which is categorized into two types of servers:

Controlling machines
Nodes
Ansible will be installed on the controlling machine and using that, machine nodes are managed with the help of SSH. Nodes’ locations are specified by inventories in that controlling machine.

Since Ansible is an agentless tool, it doesn’t require any mandatory installations on remote nodes. So, there is no need for background programs to be executed while it is managing any nodes.

Ansible can handle a lot of nodes from a single system over an SSH connection with the help of Ansible Playbooks. Playbooks are capable of performing multiple tasks, and they are in the YAML file format.

91. What is a namespace in Kubernetes?
Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users in Kubernetes. In other words, it is useful when multiple teams or users are using the same cluster which can lead to potential name collision.

####
92. What is kubectl?
By definition, kubectl is a command-line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. Here, ‘ctl’ stands for ‘control’. This ‘kubectl’ command-line interface can be used to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

####
93. How does Kubernetes help in container orchestration and deployment in a DevOps environment?
Kubernetes helps in container orchestration and deployment in a DevOps environment by providing a platform for managing, scaling, and automating the deployment of containerized applications. It allows developers to deploy and manage applications consistently across different environments and infrastructures, ensuring they are reliable, scalable, and resilient.

Kubernetes automates many tasks related to the deployment and scaling of containers, such as load balancing, scaling, and self-healing, which helps to reduce manual effort and errors and ensure that applications are always available and performing.

####
94. What are some common challenges in managing Kubernetes clusters in a DevOps environment, and how can they be addressed?
In a DevOps environment, complicated configuration management, monitoring, and troubleshooting, as well as maintaining security and compliance, are common problems in operating Kubernetes clusters.

To address these problems, several strategies can be implemented. Firstly, adopting best practices like infrastructure-as-code and declarative configuration for cluster management can streamline operations. Secondly, automating tasks through CI/CD pipelines can save time and effort. Furthermore, implementing monitoring and logging solutions enables better visibility into cluster performance and security, aiding in problem-solving efforts.

####
95. Which file is used to define dependency in Maven?
In Maven, we define all dependencies inside pom.xml so that all the dependencies will be downloaded and can be used within the project.

####
96. What are the benefits of using Maven in a DevOps environment?
Maven provides several benefits for DevOps teams, including centralized management of project dependencies, simplified build configuration using a declarative approach, and automated build and deployment processes through integration with CI/CD pipelines.

Maven also supports modular project structures, allowing teams to develop and test individual components separately, and provides consistent and reproducible builds across development, testing, and production environments. These benefits enable faster and more efficient delivery of software applications in a DevOps environment.

####
97. Why are SSL certificates used in Chef?
SSL certificates are used in Chef to establish secure and encrypted communication channels between Chef components and nodes. These certificates verify the authenticity of Chef servers and nodes, ensuring secure data transmission. By encrypting communication, SSL certificates protect sensitive information, such as authentication credentials and configuration data, from unauthorized access or tampering. This enhances the overall security of the Chef infrastructure and helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the data being exchanged.

####
98. How does Chef differ from other configuration management tools like Puppet and Ansible?
Chef differs from other configuration management tools like Puppet and Ansible in its approach to infrastructure automation. While Puppet and Ansible rely on a procedural approach, Chef uses a declarative approach, which means that users define the desired state of their infrastructure, and Chef ensures that it remains in that state. Additionally, Chef has a strong focus on testing and compliance, making it a popular choice in enterprise environments with strict security and compliance requirements.

####
99. What are the key components of a Chef deployment?
The key components of a Chef deployment include the Chef Server, which acts as the central hub for storing configuration data and Chef code; Chef Client, which runs on each node and applies the configurations defined by the Chef code; and the Chef Workstation, which is used by developers and administrators to write and test the Chef code before pushing it to the Chef Server for deployment. Other important components include cookbooks, recipes, and resources, which define the desired state of the infrastructure and the actions needed to achieve it.

####
100. What are some common integration challenges that can arise when using multiple DevOps tools?
When using multiple DevOps tools, integration challenges can arise, such as data incompatibility, conflicting configurations, and a lack of communication between tools. For example, a deployment tool may not be compatible with a monitoring tool, or a configuration management tool may have different settings from the testing tool.

Organizations can use integration frameworks, middleware, and APIs to facilitate communication between tools and ensure data consistency to overcome these challenges. It is also important to establish clear communication channels between teams using different tools to ensure effective collaboration.
